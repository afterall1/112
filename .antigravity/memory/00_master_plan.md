# EVENT HORIZON - Project Master Plan

## 1. Project Vision
**"Event Horizon"** is not just another crypto tracker. It is a futuristic WebGL experience that visualizes the volatility and momentum of the crypto market using astrophysical metaphors. Instead of a boring list of numbers, we present the market as a living, breathing cosmos.

## 2. Metaphor & Physics
The core concept revolves around the **"Event Horizon"**—the neutral zone at the center of the screen.

### The Physics of Trends
*   **The Singularity (Center):** The point of infinite density.
    *   **Fallers (Losers):** Coins dropping in value are pulled towards the Singularity. The bigger the drop, the heavier the object, and the faster it collapses inward. They are represented by **Red/Magenta** hues.
*   **Ascension Trajectory (Outer Space):** The escape path from gravity.
    *   **Risers (Gainers):** Coins gaining value defy gravity. They are ejected from the Event Horizon outwards into deep space. The higher the gain, the faster the velocity and the further they travel. They are represented by **Green/Cyan** hues.

## 3. Data Source
*   **Primary:** Binance Public API.
*   **Real-time:** Native WebSocket streams for live price ticker updates.
*   **Snapshot:** REST API (`/api/v3/ticker/24hr`) for initial state and periodic sync.

## 4. Target Audience
*   Crypto traders who want a visceral, "at-a-glance" understanding of market sentiment.
*   Tech enthusiasts who appreciate high-performance WebGL visualizations.
*   Users bored with standard spreadsheet-like exchange interfaces.

## 5. Execution Status
Uygulama başarıyla tamamlandı, Event Horizon aktif.
